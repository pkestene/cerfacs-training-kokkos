# OpenMP miniapp

Each path contains some scripts that you can use to compare the performance of the different compilers available on Piz Daint, and the scaling of your optimized implementation.

``` bash
# to test the performance of your version for different numbers of threads
# and problem sizes
. test.sh

# to compare the compilers run the following script
. test_compiler.sh
```
