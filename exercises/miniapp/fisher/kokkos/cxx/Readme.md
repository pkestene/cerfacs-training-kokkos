Proposed activities:

- go into exercise sub-directory
- observe differences with original C++ implementation (will be
  discussed during practical session), especially memory containers
  * kokkos_shared.h
  * data_warehouse.h / .cpp
- provide kokkos implementation of kernels at several locations
  * linalg.cpp
  * operators.cpp

- measure performance for different problem sizes, different backends( OpenMP / CUDA)
