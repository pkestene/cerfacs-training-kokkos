## Activity

- build with e.g. : `make CUDA_ARCH=80`
- run for multiple values of array size, and plot the speed-up of the different parallel implementation versus the serial version.
- when varying the size of the array, can you tell for each architecture (CPU x86 or GPU Nvidia) how much the run can saturate the memory bandwidth ?
- Comments ?
