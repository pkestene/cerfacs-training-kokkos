We will use project https://github.com/pkestene/pybind11-cuda to introduce / refresh the minimum knowledge to interface python with C++/Cuda code. We will review:

- how to setup a minimal projet to do that : use setup.py and Cmake to build C++/code and them build the pybind11 wrapper
- build and run example on kraken
